SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE OWNERS OF THE SITE AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS $100. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(16) INDEMNIFICATION<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the owners of this Site, its affiliates, its officers, directors, agents and employees against any asserted claims or suits made by any third party or any regulatory action brought by any entity, for any and all damages, losses, judgments, suits, claims or liabilities (including but not limited to reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees) arising from or relating to: (i) any actual or alleged breach of these terms by you and (ii) any content, data or material that you submit, post or otherwise provide to the owners of this Site.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(17) CHOICE OF LAW &amp; LEGAL FORUM<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms, Privacy Policy and your use of the Site, including all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon or arise out of or relate to the Terms, Privacy Policy and your use of the Site, will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict and choice of law principles. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms and the Privacy Policy or your use of the Site will lie in the State and Federal courts located in the State of California, and you irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of the Privacy Policy will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(18)&nbsp;ARBITRATION<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You agree that agree that any dispute or claim arising out of your use of the Site, including any dispute or claim as to the application, enforceability, scope, or interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the county where you reside. To the extent this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the &quot;<strong>Minimum Standards<\\/strong>&quot;), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear the cost of your initial filing fee.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(19) ENTIRE AGREEMENT<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, representations, warranties, conversations, or discussions between the parties relating to your use of the Site.

The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms and the Privacy Policy or your use of the Site will lie in the State and Federal courts located in the State of California, and you irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of the Privacy Policy will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the county where you reside. To the extent this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the &quot;<strong>Minimum Standards<\\/strong>&quot;), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear the cost of your initial filing fee.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(19) ENTIRE AGREEMENT<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, representations, warranties, conversations, or discussions between the parties relating to your use of the Site.

The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms and the Privacy Policy or your use of the Site will lie in the State and Federal courts located in the State of California, and you irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of the Privacy Policy will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the county where you reside. To the extent this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the &quot;<strong>Minimum Standards<\\/strong>&quot;), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear the cost of your initial filing fee.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(19) ENTIRE AGREEMENT<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, representations, warranties, conversations, or discussions between the parties relating to your use of the Site.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the county where you reside. To the extent this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the &quot;<strong>Minimum Standards<\\/strong>&quot;), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear the cost of your initial filing fee.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(19) ENTIRE AGREEMENT<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, representations, warranties, conversations, or discussions between the parties relating to your use of the Site.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE OWNERS OF THE SITE AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS $100. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(16) INDEMNIFICATION<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the owners of this Site, its affiliates, its officers, directors, agents and employees against any asserted claims or suits made by any third party or any regulatory action brought by any entity, for any and all damages, losses, judgments, suits, claims or liabilities (including but not limited to reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees) arising from or relating to: (i) any actual or alleged breach of these terms by you and (ii) any content, data or material that you submit, post or otherwise provide to the owners of this Site.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(17) CHOICE OF LAW &amp; LEGAL FORUM<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms, Privacy Policy and your use of the Site, including all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon or arise out of or relate to the Terms, Privacy Policy and your use of the Site, will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict and choice of law principles. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms and the Privacy Policy or your use of the Site will lie in the State and Federal courts located in the State of California, and you irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of the Privacy Policy will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(18)&nbsp;ARBITRATION<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You agree that agree that any dispute or claim arising out of your use of the Site, including any dispute or claim as to the application, enforceability, scope, or interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the county where you reside. To the extent this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the &quot;<strong>Minimum Standards<\\/strong>&quot;), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear the cost of your initial filing fee.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>(19) ENTIRE AGREEMENT<\\/h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, representations, warranties, conversations, or discussions between the parties relating to your use of the Site. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any representations or statements by the owners of this Site not included in these Terms and Privacy Policy.

(&quot;JAMS&quot;), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.

The Company will bear the cost of your initial filing fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
